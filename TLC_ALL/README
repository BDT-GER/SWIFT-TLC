Run "./build_package.sh $version " to build the backage. Before doing this, need to update the version info in the following files:
* ./Build/install_packages/TLC/version
* ./Build/install_packages/TLC/install.sh
* ./Build/install_packages/simulator_switcher/version (only needed if we want to build the simulator package)

packages will be built under ./Build/install_packages/*.tar.gz
